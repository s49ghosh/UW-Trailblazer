# UW Trailblazer

### Current Features that the application supports
1. The user can input previous courses through search and click then see their prerequisite
and term availabilities. Ultimately, we want this to be a drag-and-drop feature for a better
user experience. 

2. After the user has inputted previous courses, we ask them to rate them. The average
course rating is calculated and stored for each course and displayed when shown to
users. 

3. Users can filter their courses based on rating, term availability, and subject. This display
of the searched courses will provide various information, such as friends taking the
course, course term availability, subject, course code, etc.


4. Users are given the ability to select a friends from their friends and display all courses that
their friend and them both plan to take (we display the course name, course_code, subject_name, as
well as the avg_rating that course has). User is also given the ability to select a course from their
planned to take courses and will be able to see all friends (First and Last name) who are also planning
to take that course. 

5. Login and sign/up page for existing and new users. Sessions are saved and used to track
which user is using the application. Checks for incorrect passwords and stores them encrypted
in the database. 
6. Displays the highest-rated courses in the web application. Users can see this by clicking the "View Top Rated Courses"
button on the homepage.

### Fancy Features 
Final / Demo

1. Better User Experience - Nice looking UI for all the pages (Helen)

2. Security - Email confirmation after sign-up. Does not allow a user with unconfirmed email to log in. (Jasmine)

3. Efficiency - Prerequisite selecting algorithm (Jasmine)

4. Extra Functionality - Comment section for each course, can view and delete comments. (Jasmine)

5. Security - trying to find ways to break the application (ex. sql injection) (Sohom)

## Installation

Make sure you have python3 and pip installed

Create and activate virtual environment using virtualenv
```bash
$ python -m venv python3-virtualenv
$ source python3-virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies!

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to setup the database
You should install MySQL based on your system (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/installing.html)

Download MySQL Workbench to help with database management. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

run
```
$ sudo mysql -u root
$ CREATE USER 'CS348USER'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
$ GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'CS348USER'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
$ FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
$ exit
$ mysql -u myportfolio -p
```
```
$ CREATE DATABASE testDB;
```
For now - manually change the fields in the app.py file, we are not using .env files at the moment.
```
.env file
URL=localhost:5000
MYSQL_HOST=localhost
MYSQL_USER=CS348USER
MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
MYSQL_DATABASE=testDB
```

## Importing Production Dataset
Before importing the tables, run the ```createtables.sql``` in your mySQL workbench.

Then we want to import the data from the Waterloo API. We run the following command in the directory's root.

```bash
$ python call_api.py
```

Then click the link to the web application, as the web application loads, it is importing the data.

Wait until the web application displays "Tables created".

This calls API calls from https://openapi.data.uwaterloo.ca/api-docs/index.html.

BOOM! The data has been imported from the API.

## Usage

Create a .env file using the example.env template (make a copy using the variables inside of the template)

Start flask development server
```bash
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ python app.py
```

You should get a response like this in the terminal:
```
‚ùØ flask run
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You'll now be able to access the website at `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000` in the browser!
